## Description
This app is supposed to be a trivia game that has separate colors which is designated with a subject such as math, science, history, and sports. Based on the roll of the die and the intensity of the question, the player will move forward and continue throughout the game. There is a character bar that allows them to chose a character, and they can chose up to four players on a computer. These are the basics of our app.
